# Web Framework & Server
fastapi
uvicorn

# File Handling & Async
python-multipart # For FastAPI file uploads
aiofiles         # For async file I/O in upload.py

# Image Processing & Metadata
Pillow           # Image loading, basic EXIF
opencv-python    # For image processing/annotation (cv2) in DataProcessor
exifread         # More detailed EXIF reading (used in original DataProcessor)

# Machine Learning & Embeddings
torch            # PyTorch core (needed for torchvision, sentence-transformers)
torchvision      # For ResNet model
sentence-transformers # For text embeddings in search
scikit-learn     # For cosine_similarity and other ML utilities
# ultralytics    # Uncomment if you need YOLO object detection

# Geolocation
geopy            # For geocoding addresses/coordinates

# OpenAI API
openai           # For interacting with OpenAI (narrative generation)
python-dotenv    # For loading .env files (like API keys)

# Utilities
numpy            # Numerical operations (dependency for many ML libs)
tqdm             # Progress bars (used in DataProcessor)

# Removed:
# - pydantic (FastAPI manages this dependency)
# - SQLAlchemy (Using built-in sqlite3)
# - ftfy (Often a dependency, but install explicitly if needed)
# - regex (Often a dependency)
# - argparse, pathlib (Standard libraries)
# - Strict version pins (like ==x.y.z) unless absolutely necessary and known compatible
